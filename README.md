# Forensic Anthropology Toolbox
This repository is setup to be a mixture of Jupyter Notebooks that allow anyone to directly interact with forensic anthropologic imagery (both handheld and drone imagery). This toolbox will be a set of a few different components. Starting off, there will be a set of Jupyter Notebooks dedicated to the Google Colab platform. This platform is the most simple to use, but unfortunately, it doesn't give us all of the functionality we need. 


## Google Colab Notebooks
This base set of notebooks is used on the Google Colab platform. In order to use these notebooks, please refer to the GoogleColabReadme.md. The current list of notebooks is as follows, 

[ ]ImageViewer.ipynb - Basic viewer for the handheld thermal and rgb data. Also includes a viewer for the temperature sensors and other metadata that is able to be collected such as ambient temperature.
